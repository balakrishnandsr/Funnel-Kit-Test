== Approach ==

I have just added new product type "Custom Subscription" in the WooCommerce product types and added custom fields
by using the WooCommerce hooks. I need some time to complete the bugs.
Currently I have a some tasks to complete. So I am just added plugin structure here.

== Approach Should be Like==

	1 . R&D the code already available plugin in the market
	2 . Implement the POC (Proof of Concept)
	3.  Execute the functionalities to the plugin.


	I am not followed any of the above steps for this process.

Bugs:

1. The custom product type is not selected in product type ( edit page )
2. I am not implemented the calculation logic - pending
3. There is a warning in admin page - (Warning: call_user_func_array() expects parameter 1 to be a valid callback, array must have exactly two members in C:\laragon\www\bsf\wp-includes\class-wp-hook.php on line 326)
